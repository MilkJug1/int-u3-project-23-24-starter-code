    <p>You awake to your 16 birthday, something you've been waiting for all this time. You get out of your room and find
        your friends throwing you a party, during the party Super Earth Officals burst in and ask you a question. As is
        required by law by the Super Earth Government, every 16 year old is presented with the choice of joining the
        Helldivers and spreading Democracy. Will you join?</p>
